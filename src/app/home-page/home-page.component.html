            <p class="homepage-text">
                LinkTracker360 is also great for digital marketers who use Campaign Manager 360 (CM360) to manage their ad campaigns. It has the ability to read the click tags in the tracking ads template exported from CM360 and automatically return the final landing pages behind them. This makes it an invaluable tool for verifying that your ads are leading to the correct landing pages and optimizing your campaigns. Even if you use an ad server other than CM360, the multiple link tracker feature can still fulfill your needs, allowing you to check the redirection of multiple links simultaneously and get the information you need quickly and efficiently.
