    <h1>Status Codes</h1>
    <p class="statuscodes-text">
        HTTP status codes are standard response codes that indicate the status of a client's request made to a web server. 
        When a client (usually a web browser) makes a request to a server, the server responds with a three-digit status 
        code and an optional message. These status codes indicate whether the request was successful or not, and if not, why 
        it failed. For example, the 200 status code indicates a successful request, while the 404 status code indicates that 
        the requested resource was not found on the server. HTTP status codes are essential for troubleshooting errors on the 
        web and are used by developers, server administrators, and web browsers to communicate the status of web requests.
